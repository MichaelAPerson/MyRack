## Reporting a Bug

The `MyRack` team takes all security bugs in `MyRack` seriously. Thank you for helping improve the security of `MyRack`. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report security bugs by emailing the maintainer at:

**security@myrack.ct.ws**

You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours, and a detailed response within another 48 hours indicating the next steps. After the initial reply, the team will keep you informed of progress toward a fix and may ask for further information or clarification.

If the issue involves a third-party dependency used by `MyRack`, please report it to that project's maintainers.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security bug is reported, a primary handler will be assigned. This handler will coordinate the fix and release process, which includes:

- Confirming the issue and identifying affected versions.
- Auditing code for similar or related vulnerabilities.
- Preparing, testing, and publishing patches for all supported versions.
- Releasing fixes promptly via npm and GitHub with a changelog entry.
